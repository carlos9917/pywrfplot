#summary Instructions for how to use the code.

Download the code using svn, the download-tab, or grab the Python code by browsing under the source tab (look in the trunk-folder for the latest version).

You must have output files in the nc-format from WRF available in some directory on your computer. For some plots, output files from WPS (met-files) are also useful.

To avoid endless parameter lists, most settings are defined in the module [http://code.google.com/p/pywrfplot/source/browse/trunk/pywrfplotParams.py pywrfplotParams]. You must change the settings here.

Make you own Python ([http://code.google.com/p/pywrfplot/source/browse/trunk/example.py Example]) file and use the methods in the modules. For instance:

mapWRF.mapDomains()

or 

mapWRF.mapWind(nest=3,time=45)

With pywrfplot you can make [Maps], [SkewTPlots], and XzAndTzPlots.
