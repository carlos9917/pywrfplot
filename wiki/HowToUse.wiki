#summary Instructions for how to use the code.

Download the code using svn, the download-tab, or grab the Python code by browsing under the source tab (look in the trunk-folder for the latest version).

You must have output files in the nc-format from WRF available in some directory on your computer. For some plots, output files from WPS (met-files) are also useful.

To avoid endless parameter lists, most settings are defined in the module pywrfplotParams. You must change the settings here.

Make you own Python file and use the methods in the modules. For instance:

mapWRF.mapDomains()

or 

mapWRF.mapWind(nest=3,time=45)

With pywrfplot you can make [Maps], [SkewTPlots], and XzAndTzPlots.
