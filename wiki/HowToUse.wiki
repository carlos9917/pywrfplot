#summary Instructions for how to use the code.

You must have a working Python installation that includes the [InstalltionTips dependencies].

Download the code using svn or use the [http://code.google.com/p/pywrfplot/downloads download]-tab, or grab the Python code by browsing under the source tab (look in the [http://code.google.com/p/pywrfplot/source/browse/trunk/ trunk]-folder for the latest version).

You must have output files in the nc-format from WRF available in some directory on your computer. For some plots, output files from WPS (met-files) are also useful.

To avoid endless parameter lists, most settings are defined in the module [http://code.google.com/p/pywrfplot/source/browse/trunk/pywrfplotParams.py pywrfplotParams]. You must change these settings before you can make any plots.

Make you own Python file  ([http://code.google.com/p/pywrfplot/source/browse/trunk/example.py Example]) and use the methods in the modules. For instance:

{{{mapWRF.mapDomains()}}}

or 

{{{mapWRF.mapWind(nest=3,time=45)}}}

With pywrfplot you can make [Maps], [SkewTPlots], and XzAndTzPlots.
