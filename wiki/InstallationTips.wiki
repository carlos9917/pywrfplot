#summary Installtion tips

PyWRFPlot itself isn't really installed since you need to work with the code. So just copy it to some catalog on your computer and run example.py.

However the dependencies must be available in your Python runtime environment.

*Windows:* Install [http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/ PythonXY] first. If I remember correctly you may have to install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib-toolkits/ Basemap] in addition.

*Linux:* Python is distributed usually distributed with Linux, and most of the dependecies are easy to install in addition. However, I'm still struggling with Basemap.
